To get started using znc, run "znc --makeconf" to interactively create a
configuration file (~/.znc/configs/znc.conf).

Once you have znc set up, you may want to start the daemon on boot, with
this in a user's crontab:
@reboot znc

To connect to znc from your irc client, you will use a command like this:
/server <znc_server_ip> <port> <username>:<pass>
Note that the username and password are sent as the irc server password.
